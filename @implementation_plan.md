**Status**: Not started - folder structure exists but no implementation

## Phase 7: Sync Point Management UI
**Goal**: Allow users to view and edit sync points

- [ ] Create sync points list view
- [ ] Display all sync points with:
  - [ ] Rectangle ID/description
  - [ ] Associated timestamp(s)
  - [ ] Page number
- [ ] Implement sync point editing:
  - [ ] Modify timestamp
  - [ ] Delete sync point
- [ ] Add sync point validation
- [ ] Update UI when sync points change

**Status**: Not started

## Phase 8: Playback Mode Synchronization
**Goal**: Implement automatic score-video synchronization

- [ ] Track video playback position in real-time
- [ ] Implement efficient timestamp lookup in red-black tree
- [ ] Find and highlight rectangle for current timestamp
- [ ] Handle page turning when sync point is on different page
- [ ] Smooth transitions between sync points
- [ ] Handle edge cases (no sync points, gaps in timeline)

**Status**: Not started

## Phase 9: Interactive Playback
**Goal**: Enable user interaction during playback

- [ ] Detect taps on rectangles during playback
- [ ] Implement video seeking to rectangle's timestamp
- [ ] Handle rectangles with multiple timestamps:
