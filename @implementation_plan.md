- [ ] Handle edge cases (no sync points, gaps in timeline)

**Status**: Not started

## Phase 9: Interactive Playback
**Goal**: Enable user interaction during playback

- [ ] Detect taps on rectangles during playback
- [ ] Implement video seeking to rectangle's timestamp
- [ ] Handle rectangles with multiple timestamps:
